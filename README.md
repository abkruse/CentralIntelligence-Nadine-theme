##Central Intelligence Nadine Theme

This is an option theme for use with the [Nadine Membership Console](http://nadineproject.org/).

The Central Intelligence theme uses a large central logo over a main jumbotron. The navbar is located below the jumbotron image. The color scheme is pale grey with blue. To add your own logo, save your logo.png file to static/img. You can also include a flat navbar sized logo at logo-line.png.


This theme uses the Matrialize framework.
